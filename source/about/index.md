I am Sunanda Bose, Senior Research Fellow at Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Jadavpur University. Area of my research is Resource Management in Sensor Cloud Infrastructure. My area of work spans but not limited to `System Design`, `Dustributed Architecture`, `Optimization`, `Mathematical Modeling`, `Metaheuristics`, `Computational Geometry`, `Spatio Temporal Analysis`. Since 2014 I have been working on the project *Remote Health: A Framework for Healthcare Services using Mobile and Sensor-Cloud Technologies*. Objective of this project was to deliver healthcare to rural areas of West Bengal, India, via Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Health Kiosks has been set up in [Barhra](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barhra,+Arjjunshuli,+West+Bengal+731125/@23.7946119,87.1629744,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39f73ef3de8feceb:0x3aaf6bea78d8cf76!8m2!3d23.7946636!4d87.1665962) village of Birbhum district and [Bali](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&hs=9wY&tbs=lf:1,lf_ui:1&tbm=lcl&sxsrf=ALeKk019AlUVnJgAScWmJ-OqzX-u4yksPA:1609073051464&q=Bali+Island+Sundarban+West+Bengal&rflfq=1&num=10&ved=2ahUKEwj1sJmdmO7tAhXpIbcAHW-wA-UQtgN6BAgDEAc#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:[[22.1849895,89.2085097],[21.8160974,88.738496]];tbs:lrf:!1m4!1u2!2m2!2m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e1!1m4!1u16!2m2!16m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e16!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:1) island in sundarbans during the tenure of this project. These kiosks has been operated with the health workers working at the village and the doctors working at city remotely.I have previously worked at School of Cultural Texts and Records, Jadavpur University for developing a [Text Collation Engine](http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in/bibliography/bengali_fiction_table.php) under project [Bichitra](http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in/index.php). I am also involved in developing and contributing to Open Source Softwares in [Github](http://github.com/neel) and [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com/neel.basu). Before joining Jadavpur University I used to work as a software developer in different companies. My programming skills include but not limited to `C++`, `Network Programming`, `Boost`, `Qt`, `Mathematica`, `Javascript`, `python`, `PHP`.
